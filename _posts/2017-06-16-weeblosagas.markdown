Saga 1

Written by Gary Lutz


This story is purely fictional. Any similarities in characters to any real person is strictly coincidental. No Weblos were harmed during the making of this story.

DAY 1: 1900 hrs our dorm just got together and we are making our way to brava camp aka dinging hall, me and Heykoop are bringing up the front while Pudge adam and ed are bringing up the rear. Our scout (Curtis) brings back news of movement up ahead; it seems the Weblos are massing for a large offensive. We have to find another way around. How? Platoon srg. Mr. Pennington decides not to attack from the front, he sends commandos Matt Devenny and that James kid to look for another way around.

DAY1 : 1954 hrs Devin and that James kid come back bringing good news, there is an enemy bridge to the south that is not heavily guarded, "big bazooka daddy evens" and heavy machine gunner Phil Myers are sent in to clear the Weblos nest of their own machine guns. evans fires direct hit while Phil scares the rest off with short bursts of his mini gun.

DAY1: 2003hrs success

DAY 2: 640 hrs Pudge, Ed Pujat and myself decide to secure gamma shower quadrant, not much resistance we make it through with 0 casualties

DAY 2: 1204 hrs the lake, it is crawling with Seablos, water Weblos and other creatures, we call in navy seal Camden "candy" he is the only guy who can sail upside down, wait what’s that? Giggles, laughter, its GANNET!!! They are trapped on the lake in sailboats! water Weblos are as thick as women all over Puddle’s car, quickly Jason Leeks Camden Devin and everyone else is loading up the canoes for war, as our flotilla nears we realize we are heavily outgunned , we fight with desperation, that James kid goes in, Camden rushes to save him but its too late... suddenly over all the carnage a voice can be heard, its Ed, mango, our savior, he yells "RALLY TO MISS TROYER " !!!! We fight hack and cleave our way through... we fight back to back, such a fierce onslaught I have never seen, I saw a water Weblos jump on Heykoop's back, I raised my m-16 took aim and fired, got him but Chris is wounded, something hits me in the back of the head and everything goes black...I wake up on the beach, how did I get here I wonder, all around my platoon "attucks2" are licking their wounds, I ask "wild thing" Camden how we got back, he replies Leah came out with a pt10 (motor boat) and pulled us in how many did we lose? We lose James and 3 girls from gannet. Heykoop has sustained minor injuries and Pudge is a little hungry for pizza. war is not pretty...

DAY 3: 1400 hrs it is my and Pudge's turn on guard duty, we are walking along the path to pathfinder when Curtis's HOTT sister runs towards us. She explains that she heard something in the trees. Pudge and me exchange glances. We know what this means, the water Weblos are angry at the defeat we dealt them so they are asking their kin the trebles to help them, we offer to escort Curtis's hott sister back to camp, its quiet too quiet, all of a sudden a big explosion in front of us, then the trees come to life with eerie chit chatter, I radio in back up as soon as I can, mother eagle we have tangos spotted we need evac as soon as possible I don’t know how long we can last... no reply. I throw Amada my side arm, a 10mm desert eagle, in the distance I can see a tank in the shape of an ear of corn appear, we give as good as we get but we cant last much longer, we are in trouble I think, Dan’s expression says it all, we are both scared outta our minds. Wait a minute, the tank explodes, in the distance I can hear our war cry, tuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkksssssss 2!!! Ed p'jat Devenny and big daddy Evans break cover, move move move I yell, we run till we are back at bravo point, we are safe for now...

DAY4: 900hrs it is our turn for copes, whatever that is, the platoon is a little nervous, we don’t know what’s in store for us, we get in the transport to go down to copes. As soon as we get there we are greeted by a man named "Kevin" he hooks us up with harnesses (some longer then others) he plays with Pudgey's caribeaner forever it seems, I overhear him conversing with his fellow comrades but I cant hear what they are saying. As p'juat goes up and is halfway through Kevin suddenly says "now". Thousands of Weblos and treeblos come form no where! They cut p'jats rope and he falls with a sickening crunch. I go over to him, no darn it live !! Sniff sniff I love u p'jat I say, Kevin is going to pay, regardless of the battle around me I pick up my assault rifle and mow my way to where the coward is hiding....

So there I was face to face with Kevin. (Not Troyer) the gay on, he begged and pleaded for his life. I took some wire out of my backpack and tied his hands together. We will deal with traitors later I said. Besides, there was a full battalion of Weblos to break through. I unloaded my magazine into the break in the ridge ahead of me. Curtis and Ed helped Pujat up. Can you make it p’Jat. He replied with a nod. We had to get p’Jat outa there. He had sustained back injuries. When all is lost it is discipline that saves the day. The Weblos charged and charged again but tucks 2 platoon bravely stood our ground. A lot of people would have turned and run but with bravery and heroics we stood our ground. Shrapnel was flying everywhere and Rick went down with some iron is his left shoulder. Greg told lesko to get on the mobile phone and request evac. The reply was 10-20 minutes until they could organize a pull out team. Some of the treeblos artillery was almost in range. We couldn’t last much longer. Suddenly a crackle over the mic: tucks 2 tucks 2 this is Attucks 1 what is your position. Mr. Greg told him, " echo niner we are 2 cliques away from the copes course. The reply was we are on our way. Suddenly a brilliant ray of light lit up the embankment, there was only one guy who could do that, flame-thrower man Toomie disher came bursting through backed by ekama, Welch, and Paul sheerin. Move move move Toomie yelled at us. Tucks 2 move out double time! We ran as fast and hard as our battle torn figures could go. booooooom, a grenade exploded to the right and Pudge went down, I went down beside him, come on, let’s go I screamed! Pudge looked at his leg looked at me and said I don’t think I will be able to make it, bull crap I said get up, I ain’t leaven a man behind! Big daddy Evans give me a hand I yelled, between Evans and me we lifted Pudge to the jeep. We made it back to base camp at 2100 hrs, today wasn’t good, Pujat had back injuries and pudge's left leg was bleeding like there wasn’t a tomorrow.

DAY 4: 1200 hrs, no Weblos activity of late, we are all wondering when the next attack will take place, reckon team Dan Thomas (saga kid) Boris, and Matt szalamkawietz are sent out from attucks 1 to investigate reported sightings of a new breed of Weblos near the volleyball courts.

DAY 4: 1600 hrs, no reports from reckon team 1. Both our Platoon and Attucks 1 are worried about this.

DAY 4 2000 hrs, still no sign of reckon team 1, we are about to send a joint pull out team when Boris staggers up limping. MEDIC he yells and collapses on the ground. Quickly field medic Andrew Tranquada walks up and reports he is hurt, of course he is hurt stupid!! Fix him we yell. He eventually comes around and delivers some scary new news...

Boris stumbled into base camp bleeding from what seemed an endless gash growing from his right side. When he was better he related to us what had happened. A new breed of Weblos like no one has ever seen: a Supereblo. Boris told us of what took place. We were investigating the volleyball court when all of a sudden 3 Weblos, we thought they were Weblos but in fact they were Supereblos were standing in front of us not afraid. Saga boy said let’s teach these Weblos what’s up. I can know say I have seen men empty entire clips at Weblos hitting nothing but air. They were too fast. Then one started to speak. Mr. ekama, come with us. We weren’t about to allow some Weblos to take us in so ekama took out his mp10 submachine gun and opened fire. He hit nothing, absolutely nothing. The claws of the Weblos tore at Nathan’s arm, making him drop the machine gun. Saga boy tried to help him but a second Supereblo used its agility to knock him over and rip at his face. I pulled out my knife and charged but the raking claws of the Supereblo tore my side apart like confetti. By sure luck my knife in hand went done into the Weblos arm releasing me letting me run as far as I could.

That is when I arrived here... the platoon looked at Boris then at our leaders and everyone knew they didn’t want to be there now. Facing a new force as strong as a Supereblo is a pretty intimidating thing. At that moment we heard footsteps, we turned around pointed our guns at the oncoming noise and waited... CURTIS!! We all relaxed our trigger fingers for the moment; Curtis what are you doing we almost turned you into Swiss cheese. He was breathing heavy. Weblos...huff huff .... took me...huff huff by... suprise.... thousands...entire puff...cough camp..gone..cough cough underground...secret...weblo city.. and he faints from exhaustion. The response is immediate, even with this new threat the Supereblo, both tucks 1 and tucks 2 want to go into the lion’s den and pull em out. A council of war is set to take place immediately for the leaders while everyone one else is sent to gather supplies and every weapon available...

next installment: when ever death looks someone in the face, all a man can do is smile back.

Webelos: 100% natural. Provides 9 essential vitamins and minerals. (based on a 2,000 calorie diet)

TUCK'S! TUCK'S! TUCK'S! THANK YOU BASKETBALL STAFF!" This cheer echoed across the basketball court. It caught the wind and was blown down an airshaft to faintly be heard in the underground city of the Webelos; Webelania. The Webelos had thrived here for years...always finding new recruits among the young boyscouts who traveled to the camp, who did not know the terror that lurked below. But now there was a different kind of camp here...and the webelos didn't like it one bit....

The 6 Webelo scouts stood before the throne of their king, afraid to move, afraid to speak.

"And you say that this,this Tucks 2? They made fun of our sigil?", asked the leader.

"Ye...yes your highness.", stammered one of the scouts. "A group of them was walking along and saw it in the ampitheater. One called Gary and another called Pudge Milla said it looks like an ear of corn."

"This will not be toleratered!", shouted the king, "We must call to our allies the Seabelos, Water Webelos, and the Treebelos. It is time to teach this camp above us who rules Heritage!"

The scouts all looked to their king and were frightened by what they saw...there was madness in his eyes, but mostly gayness, they were afraid he was undressing them with his eyes. Yes, gayness, for their king was none other than Kevin Gaybelo! Gayest of all webelos!

"All hail King Kevin Gaybelo!", they shouted. "I've told you guys, like don't call me that!" King Kevin said with a gay-like flip of the wrist and a gay sissyboy voice,"I am like sooo not gay!"

"We are deeply sorry your gayness...er...your highness.", replied the head scout with a roll of his eyes.

"You are dismissed.", said the King Kevin Gaybelo, "Send in my lover...i mean, friend, Tree-frogger. I have some PRESSING business i need yo discuss with him."

"I can't believe that worked!", said Chris Heykoop as he peeled of his Webelo scout disguise.

"I can," said Commander Lutz, "Webelos aren't too bright. But they are darn good fighter's!"

"I gues that confirms it Commander." Said Adam.

"Confirms what, Kevin is gay?"

"No, we all already knew that, well, except Kim.....but it confirms that the Webelos are coming, and they aren't gonna be easy to stop."

"Strength and honor.", said Commander Lutz quietly.

"Strength and honor.", said Adam.

"Strength and honor.", said Heycoop.

"Strength and honor.", said Micah who had finally showed up...where the heck does that kid wander off too!!

"I want to punt toomie...oh yea...strength and honor.", said Ed

Mustang Milla just kept wickering nervously..."It's ok Mustang," Adam said patting him on the shoulder, "it's ok."

Far beneath them King Kevin Gaybelo was told that his scouts were found bound and gagged in a latrine. The scouts said that Tucks 2 did it. "I'll get you!!!", he shouted, "And your little monkey too!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Hour 1: It was dark and we were all tired. We hadn't had any fake food or powdered juice in hours and were craving it like vampires crave chicken. I had found myself cut off from the rest of the party searching for Kevin(no the gay one) and had seen no one in the distance. I heard a faint sound that seemed to sound exactly like a horse, but then I realized it was just Mustang Miller getting uneasy again. Before I knew it, I had fallen into a cavern and was surrounded by webelos.

There must of been thousands in that cavern. I reached for my gun, but I then saw how the webelos were studying it in a corner off to the left. All of a sudden, a swarm of them rushed towards me, and jammed a diskette into my head.

Hour 2: As I came to, and the bleeding stopped, I suddenly had the urge to punt toomie, call adam p'jat, kick Gary if he was ever in boxes, and I somehow began to sing n sync. I cried out in pain as I knew what they had done. As I stood up, the webelos noticed the rage in my eyes. One of them quitely said,"hooooo mama."

I saw the opening in the distance, and I saw my fellow campers waiting for me. So I did the only thing natural, I dropped a grenade and ran like the webelos were singing like Matt Devinny does. The entire cavern exploded behind me as I ran into an ambush of treebelows. But, punctual as ever, Commander lutz brought his unit in from the east and quickly destroyed the threat.

Hour 3: Everything was back to normal at camp. Except for a fatal loss. We had lost Matt Devinny, who gave away his position again by singing, except this time his gun was unloaded and the webelos took no mercy in eating all the flesh off his body. As I saw this I immediatlely punted Toomie, and then I vomited. Yes yes, there was lots of vomiting. So much vomitining I think i will vomit from how much vomit there was.

Hour 4: We lost another flank. The webelos were getting closer and closer the camp, as we had heard nothing of the search for the faggot kevin guy who was the main gimp for the webelo tribe. We all were a little worried. I just could not stop punting toomie, he began to question my loyalty to the campers. The majority of the camp had thoughts of me being a synthesizer. I knew nothing of these accusations, until I saw Gary in many boxes and began to kick him rapidly. The campers began to stone me. As i was blacking out, I heard a loud voice cry,"They're coming from the trees!!" We all looked in horror as thousands of webelos swarmed into our camp and began their flesh feast. We had to leave base camp, but we left a nice surprise of plastic explosive which destroyed the webelo threat to our safety right then. And there was much vomiting.

Hour 5: We decided it best to rejoin the others looking for the faggot. But what happened along the way would rock human kinds very existence....... not really but I had to have something to end on.
